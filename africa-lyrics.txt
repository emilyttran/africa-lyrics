I heer the drums eckoing tonite
But she hearz only whispers of sum quiet conversashunnn
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings refleckt the stars that guide m3 towards salvaaaashun
I stopped an old man along teh way
Hoping to find some long forgotten wordz or ancient melodis
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry BOI, it's waiting there for uuuu"
